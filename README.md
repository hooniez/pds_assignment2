# pds_assignment2

The purpose of this assignment is to develop and implement steps for data modelling as a part of the data science process. 

The tasks included in this assignment are:
1. Retrieving and Preparing the Data 
* Pre-process the data before starting the analysis and modeling process.
2. Data Exploration 
* Explore each column in the data using descriptive statistics and graphs, and report observations.
* Explore the relationship between all pairs of attributes and generate a visual representation for each pair.
3. Data Modelling 
* Model the data by treating it as either a Classification or Clustering task.
* Use two different models, one for Classification and one for Clustering.
* Train and evaluate the models appropriately.
4. Presentation and Automation 
* Write a report in PDF format explaining the goal of the project, pre-processing steps, observations from data exploration, and results from data modeling.
